When we want to only sometimes display something on the page based on a Condtional
of some sort

when you need to decide to whhich thing among 2 options to display


4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?

Regular condtional statement (if...else is) or 'switch' statement that happens outside of the
return statement (if...else is
)

function App() {
    let someVar
    if () {
        someVar = <SomeJSX />
    } else if() {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }
    return (
        <div>{someVar}</div>
    )
}
