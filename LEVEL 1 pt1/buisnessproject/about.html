                 You're probably wondering how we got here.
                 Well it started way way way back in 2016.
                 When me and the boys loved helping out fellow musicians around
                 nashville TN. Had a specific sound you wanted? We got you.
                 Wanted some cool insight? Bam. You got it. 
                 And we figured we could get paid to do it. And here we are.
