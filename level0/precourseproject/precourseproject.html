        <ol>
            <li>29 years old</li>
            <li> Grew up in Hartland, MI</li>
            <li> Played some type of instrument most of my life. Mainly play guitar.</li>
            <li> Joined the Army year after high school. Became an Abrams mechanic and specialized as an M88 operator.
            </li>
            <li> I enjoy movies and music and how they are created.</li>
            <li> PC gaming is a fun hobby and a way I relax. (if you can get me a 3080 for regular price, let me know.)

        <ul>
            <li>Exhausted in working in hard labor jobs.</li>
            <li>Prove to myself I'm capable if I put my mind to it.</li>
            <li>Messing with computers/routers as a teenager. Wanted to know how code and the internet worked together.
            </li>
            <li>Seeing software used in abrams, and how one component could deadline the whole system. I found
                interesting!</li>
